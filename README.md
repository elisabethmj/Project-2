# Project-2
Flask app

## [Deployed game via Heroku](https://vast-sea-43918.herokuapp.com/)

Things to do:

1. Fix database/SQL:
    - Add cuisine to restaurants database
    - Change user_id column to username on restaurants database
    - Add location to user database (so they can say what city they are in)

2. Features to add:
    - Have landing page include content from all users e.g. "See other favourites": last 10 restaurants uploaded with usernames displayed in your city & link to their profile
    - When not logged in, nav bar includes home, login, register
    - When you log in, nav bar includes home, profile, log out & add restaurant
    - Profile page with all your restaurants and options to update/delete
    - ? Search function in explore or profile page
    - ? Can see other users profiles but without option to edit their tables

3. CSS:
    - Decide on thematic colours/look
    - Decide on table-like display of each restaurant ? drop down 
    - Make a cool nav bar 
    - Fix up each page - explore/home & profile could be similar, login & register could be similar
